To begin the virtual internship, in module 1, I am given 3 different datasets to work on:
- Customer Demographics
- Customer Address
- Transactions

#### The goal for this module is:
- Asked and understood the right and clear business problem our client was asking
- Prepared by assessing the data quality in all datasets
- Emailed the client addressing all the data quality issues attaching the appropriate mitigation as well as recommendation.
