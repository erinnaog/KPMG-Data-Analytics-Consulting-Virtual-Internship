To begin the virtual internship, in module 1, I am given 3 different datasets to work on:

| Tables               | No. of Record | Date Received  |
| -------------------- |:-------------:| --------------:|
| CustomerDemographic  | 4000          | 2021-08-14     |
| CustomerAddress      | 3999          | 2021-08-14     |
| Transaction          | 20000         | 2021-08-14     |

#### The goal for this module is:
- Ask and understand the right and clear business problem our client was asking
- Prepare by assessing the data quality in all datasets
- Emaile the client addressing all the data quality issues attaching the appropriate mitigation as well as recommendation.
